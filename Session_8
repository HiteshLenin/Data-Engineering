CTE : Common table expressions
A CTE is a temporary named result set created using the WITH clause.
It exists only for the duration of a single SQL query.
•	Improves readability of complex queries
•	Can be referenced multiple times within the same query
•	Supports recursive queries.
Anchor Member:
•	The anchor member is the base query of a recursive CTE.
It starts the recursion and produces the initial result set.
•	Without the anchor member, recursion cannot begin.
Recursive member:
The recursive member is the part of a recursive CTE that references the CTE itself and is repeatedly executed to build on the results produced by the anchor member.
It expands the result set step by step until no new rows are returned. 
Temporary Table:
A temporary table is a physical table created temporarily and stored in memory (or disk).
It exists only for the current session.
•	Automatically dropped when session ends
•	Faster for intermediate processing
•	Not visible to other sessions
•	Reusing data across multiple queries
View:
A view is a virtual table created from a stored SQL query.
It does not store data, only the query definition.
•	Stored permanently in the database
•	Data is fetched dynamically
•	Improves security and abstraction
•	Can simplify complex queries
•	Stored in memory by default
Data Abstraction: 
Data abstraction means hiding complex database logic (tables, joins, calculations) and exposing only the required data to users in a simplified form.
In MySQL, views are a primary mechanism to achieve data abstraction.
