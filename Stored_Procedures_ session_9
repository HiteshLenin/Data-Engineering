Stored Procedure?
A stored procedure is a named block of SQL code saved inside the database. You can execute it whenever needed.
A stored procedure lets the database behave like a program, not just a place to store data.
•	Reusability: write once, call many times
•	Security: users can be allowed to run a procedure without direct table access
•	Maintainability: logic centralized in DB
•	Executes multiple SQL statements together
•	Can accept input values
•	Can return output values
•	Can contain logic (conditions, loops, variables)
•	Runs on the database server, not on the client
